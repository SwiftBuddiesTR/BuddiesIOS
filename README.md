## Project details

If you're landing here for the first time, welcome to the Buddies Community iOS application project! This app, built with SwiftUI & Tuist, is the result of a collective effort driven by our community, comprising newcomers as well as seasoned professionals in iOS development.

Buddies Community, being a platform dedicated to iOS development, aims to provide a productive environment fostering networking, collaboration, and knowledge sharing. Here, every member has an opportunity to contribute to the project, learn from the best, and get their hands dirty with real-world project experience. Our aim is to make this experience as enriching as possible, thereby helping members grow professionally and become better, more informed developers.

It’s a space where you can share new ideas, discuss designs, learn architectural patterns, get feedback, and much more. And all of this around a practical project that continues to evolve, just like the tech industry itself.

The iOS app offers features such as feed sharing, location suggestions, a comprehensive about section, and a contributors pane acknowledging those who've participated in developing this app. It's not just another pet project, but an application that is enriched with every contribution, making its value significantly higher than a solo endeavor.

We invite you to explore this repository, install the app, and most importantly, contribute in whatever way you can. If you're skilled in Scala or Tuist, great! If you're not, great! We value all contributions and believe that everyone has something valuable to share.

So dive in, explore, learn and share. We're excited to have you here and can't wait to see what you'll bring to the table. Welcome aboard!
